# The Date Challenge

Create an application that can read in pairs of dates in the following format -

    DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY

Validate the input data, and compute the difference between the two dates in days.

Output of the application should be of the form -

    DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY, difference

Where the first date is the earliest, the second date is the latest and the difference is the number of days.

Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.

Provide test data to exercise the application.

## Constraints

The application may not make use of the libraries for date manipulation (for example Date, Calendar classes).

The application can limit calculation on an input range of dates from 1900 to 2010

## Deliverables

The source files, the test data and any test code.
